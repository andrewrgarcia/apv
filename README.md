## 🎯 Overview

**APV (Axis · Pivot · Veil)** is a perfect-information strategy game inspired by  
principles of **military strategic thinking**. Victory comes not from destruction,  
but from **containment and foresight** — immobilizing your opponent’s *Pivot*,  
the command node.

The game explores **anticipation**, **tempo control**, and **positional geometry**  
within a compact, elegant hex-grid environment.

## ♟️ Core Mechanics

| Piece | Symbol | Role | Movement |
|-------|---------|------|-----------|
| **Pivot** | ● | Command node | Moves 1 hex any direction |
| **Axis** | ▲ | Line controller | Moves in a straight line until blocked |
| **Veil** | ◆ | Flanker | Jumps 2 hexes in any direction, ignoring the in-between hex |

---

## 🧭 Objective

Immobilize your opponent’s **Pivot (●)** by cutting off all six adjacent hexes.  
No pieces are captured — only contained.  
A draw occurs if both Pivots are simultaneously immobilized.

---

## 🧠 Future Orders

After a move, a player may issue one **Future Order** —  
a delayed command that executes automatically at the start of their next turn  
if the target hex remains open. This models *anticipation and initiative.*
