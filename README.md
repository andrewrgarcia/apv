## 🎯 Overview

**APV (Axis · Pivot · Veil)** is a perfect-information strategy game inspired by  
principles of **strategic foresight** and **systems design**.  
Victory is achieved not through destruction, but through **containment** —  
immobilizing the opponent’s *Pivot*, the command node.

The game explores **anticipation**, **tempo control**, and **positional geometry**  
in a minimal yet deeply strategic hex-grid environment.

## ♟️ Core Mechanics

| Piece | Symbol | Role | Movement |
|-------|---------|------|-----------|
| **Pivot** | ● | Command node | Moves 1 hex any direction |
| **Axis** | ▲ | Line controller | Slides straight until blocked |
| **Veil** | ◆ | Flanker | Jumps 2 hexes, ignoring the intervening hex |

---

## 🧠 Future Orders

After moving, a player may issue one **Future Order** —  
a delayed command that executes automatically at the start of their next turn  
if the target hex remains open. This models anticipation and initiative.
