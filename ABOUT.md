# üß≠ About APV ‚Äî Axis ¬∑ Pivot ¬∑ Veil  
*A study in deterministic strategy and foresight.*

---

## 1. Concept

**APV** was designed as a compact system for exploring **foresight, tempo, and containment**.  
Every outcome is visible. Every move reveals intent. Victory comes not from force,  
but from immobilizing the command node through superior positional geometry.

APV abstracts strategic control into a perfect-information duel ‚Äî  
a model of **initiative**, **commitment**, and **constraint**.

---

## 2. Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Clarity over chance** | No randomness. Every result is earned. |
| **Containment over combat** | Control space rather than destroy units. |
| **Temporal commitment** | Future Orders expose intent and invite counterplay. |
| **Minimalism with depth** | Five pieces per side; infinite variation. |

The design aims to train **strategic reasoning** under deterministic rules ‚Äî  
a game of clarity, not chaos.

---

## 3. Strategic Framework

APV reflects real-world systems thinking:

- **Initiative** ‚Äî control of sequence and tempo  
- **Containment** ‚Äî defining and limiting opponent mobility  
- **Foresight** ‚Äî commitment to visible intent  
- **Geometry** ‚Äî translating structure into advantage

It is less a wargame than a **strategic cognition trainer** ‚Äî  
a space for studying how anticipation and transparency interact.

## 4. Development

Created by **Dr. Andrew R. Garcia**,  
systems engineer and cognitive-AI researcher focused on the intersection of  
**artificial intelligence, strategic foresight, and human decision design.**

Originally conceived as a teaching tool and research model,  
APV evolved into a playable framework for studying foresight and constraint  
in perfectly deterministic systems.

## 6. Purpose

APV functions as:

- A **strategy game**, emphasizing foresight and structure  
- A **teaching tool**, modeling operational clarity  
- A **research abstraction**, testing the limits of deterministic anticipation

It challenges reasoning, not reflex ‚Äî a minimalist experiment in strategic thought.
